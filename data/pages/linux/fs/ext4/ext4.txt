====== EXT4 ======

==== Mount options for ext4 ====

在Android中用emmc做data区时，mount时加上noauto_da_alloc选项，可以大幅提高I/O测试分数。

<code>
auto_da_alloc|noauto_da_alloc
              Many broken applications don't use fsync() when noauto_da_alloc replacing existing files via patterns such as

              fd = open("foo.new")/write(fd,..)/close(fd)/ rename("foo.new", "foo")

              or worse yet

              fd = open("foo", O_TRUNC)/write(fd,..)/close(fd).

              If auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the replace-via-rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and force that any delayed allocation  blocks  are
              allocated  such that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk before the rename()
              operation is commited.  This provides roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the "zero-length" problem that can happen  when  a  system
              crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are forced to disk.
